This project extracts key information from resume images (JPG, PNG, JPEG) using OCR and uploads parsed data to a Google Sheet.

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Required Packages

Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit pytesseract pillow opencv-python numpy gspread oauth2client
2. Install Tesseract OCR
Download and install Tesseract OCR from here.

Note the installation path (you will need to update the config).

3. Configure Tesseract Executable Path
In the Python script, set the TESSERACT_CMD_PATH variable to the full path of the tesseract.exe on your machine.

Example (Windows):

python
Copy
Edit
TESSERACT_CMD_PATH = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"
4. Setup Google Sheets API Credentials
Create a Google Cloud project and enable Google Sheets API.

Create a Service Account and download the JSON credentials file.

Share your target Google Sheet with the service account email (found in the JSON).

Save the credentials JSON file locally (e.g., creds.json).

5. Update Project Configuration
In the Python script, update the following placeholders:

python
Copy
Edit
GOOGLE_CREDS_JSON = "<PATH_TO_YOUR_CREDS_JSON_FILE>"
GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME = "<YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME>"
Example:

python
Copy
Edit
GOOGLE_CREDS_JSON = "creds.json"
GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME = "RecruitmentData"
6. Keep Credentials Private
Do NOT upload your creds.json file to any public repository.

Add the following line to your .gitignore file to avoid committing sensitive files:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
creds.json
7. Run the App
Run the Streamlit app locally with:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run your_script_name.py
Upload a resume image via the app interface, verify extracted info, and upload it to your Google Sheet.

Notes
This app works with image files (JPG, PNG, JPEG) only.

Google Sheets API requires correct sharing permissions for the service account.

Modify or extend regex patterns and skill lists as needed for your use case.

For production deployment, securely manage secrets and credentials.
